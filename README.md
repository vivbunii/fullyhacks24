## Overview
Welcome to Project Nyaan ‚Äì a delightful entry for FullyHacks24! üêæ

In the neon-soaked streets of Neonotropolis, where cyberpunk met feline charm, lived a unique digital cat known as Nyaan. Nyaan was not your ordinary cat; it was a cybernetic marvel with a penchant for mischief and a glowing neon trail that illuminated its path through the bustling city.

In the heart of Neonotropolis, known as the Neon-Nexus, a malevolent force known as Byte Bane unleashed a digital storm, plunging the once vibrant city into chaos. Nyaan's serene Neon-Nap Lounge became a distorted realm of glitchy mayhem, prompting the enigmatic feline to rise as the city's beacon of hope.
